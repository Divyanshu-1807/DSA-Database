## Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock III

You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete at most two transactions.

**Note:** You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

### Constraints:
- `1 <= prices.length <= 10^5`
- `0 <= prices[i] <= 10^5`

### Example:
**Input:** 
```plaintext
prices = [3, 3, 5, 0, 0, 3, 1, 4]
```

**Output:** 
```plaintext
6
```
