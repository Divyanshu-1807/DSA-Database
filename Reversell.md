## Reverse Linked List

### Problem Statement:
Given the head of a singly linked list and two integers `left` and `right` where `left <= right`, reverse the nodes of the list from position `left` to position `right`, and return the reversed list.

### Constraints:
- The number of nodes in the list is `n`.
- `1 <= n <= 500`
- `-500 <= Node.val <= 500`
- `1 <= left <= right <= n`

### Example:

head = [1,2,3,4,5], left = 2, right = 
```
**Output:**
```plaintext
[1,4,3,2,5]
```
