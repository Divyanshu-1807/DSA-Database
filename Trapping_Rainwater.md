## Trapping Rain Water

### Problem Description

Given `n` non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water can be trapped after raining.

### Constraints
- `n == height.length`
- `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^4`
- `0 <= height[i] <= 10^5`

### Example

**Input:** 
```bash
height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]
```
**Output:** 
```bash
9
```
