## Flood Fill Problem

You are given an image represented by an `m x n` grid of integers `image`, where `image[i][j]` represents the pixel value of the image. You are also given three integers `sr`, `sc`, and `color`. Your task is to perform a flood fill on the image starting from the pixel `image[sr][sc]`.

### Problem Statement:

To perform a flood fill:

1. Begin with the starting pixel and change its color to `color`.
2. Perform the same process for each pixel that is directly adjacent (pixels that share a side with the original pixel, either horizontally or vertically) and shares the same color as the starting pixel.
3. Keep repeating this process by checking neighboring pixels of the updated pixels and modifying their color if it matches the original color of the starting pixel.
4. The process stops when there are no more adjacent pixels of the original color to update.

Return the modified image after performing the flood fill.

### Constraints

- `m == image.length`
- `n == image[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 50`
- `0 <= image[i][j], color < 216`
- `0 <= sr < m`
- `0 <= sc < n`

### Example

#### Input
```plaintext
image = [[1,1,1],[1,1,0],[1,0,1]], sr = 1, sc = 1, color = 2
```
#### Output
```plaintext
[[2,2,2],[2,2,0],[2,0,1]]
```
