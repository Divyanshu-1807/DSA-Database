## Kth Smallest Element in a BST

### Problem Statement: 
Given the root of a binary search tree, and an integer `k`, return the kth smallest value (1-indexed) of all the values of the nodes in the tree.

### Constraints:
- The number of nodes in the tree is `n`.
- `1 <= k <= n <= 10^4`
- `0 <= Node.val <= 10^4`

### Example :

root = [3,1,4,null,2], k = 1
```
#### Output:
```plaintext
